{"id":90,"q":"Q90. (Comprehension Passage)\n\nWhile education and wisdom are often conflated in everyday discourse, a discerning mind perceives a fundamental difference between the two.\nEducation is the formal acquisition of knowledge, usually measured through degrees, academic achievements, and proficiency in structured disciplines.\nIt is delivered through systematic curricula, institutional assessments, and theoretical frameworks.\n\nHowever, wisdom transcends this rigidity; it is the judicious application of knowledge to real-life situations, enriched by experience, introspection, and emotional intelligence.\nAn individual may be highly educated yet lack wisdom if they are unable to apply their learning ethically and effectively. Conversely, many wise individuals — farmers, artisans, elders — may not possess formal education, but their decisions exhibit prudence and sagacity cultivated through lived experience.\n\nThus, education equips the mind, but wisdom enriches the soul. In an era dominated by information overload and algorithmic thinking, the gap between the two has widened.\nEducational institutions often prioritise rote memorisation and standardised testing over critical thinking and moral reasoning. Consequently, society produces people skilled in problem-solving but deficient in decision-making that requires empathy, patience, or foresight.\n\nWisdom, being innately human, cannot be downloaded or fast-tracked; it is earned through trial, failure, reflection, and a nuanced understanding of human nature. Furthermore, while education is temporally bounded — ending with formal schooling or academic milestones — wisdom is a lifelong pursuit. It does not boast certificates but manifests in humility, ethical consistency, and the ability to navigate ambiguity with grace.\n\nUltimately, the highest form of intelligence lies not merely in knowing what is right, but in consistently choosing to do it, especially when it is inconvenient.","opts":["A.
